# EPQ-Chess-AI-Artefact
For my EPQ, I worked on creating a chess programme using Python. I used SQLite for the database, Python-chess for basic chess logic, Pygame for the simple interface and Stockfish's API for evaluation. This repository stores the finished programme after 2 cycles of testing and debugging.
